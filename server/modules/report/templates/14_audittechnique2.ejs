            Code Quality Evaluation:
        </li>
        <div>
            The audit included an in-depth analysis of the smart contract code, assessing readability, maintainability,
            and adherence to industry coding standards. Best practices for smart contract development were considered,
            and recommendations for code improvement were provided.

            Compliance Review:


        </li>
        <div>To ensure adherence to industry standards and protocols, the audit team reviewed the smart contract against
            relevant specifications, such as ERC-20 or ERC-721. Any deviations were identified and reported, along with
            recommendations for alignment.

            Gas Efficiency Analysis:
        </li>
        <div>
            Gas consumption patterns were analyzed to evaluate the efficiency of contract execution. Recommendations for
            optimizing gas usage and improving overall cost-effectiveness were provided.

            Functionality and Logic Verification:
            <div>
                The intended functionalities of the smart contract were rigorously tested to verify their accuracy and
                reliability. The audit team identified and addressed any logical errors, edge cases, or inconsistencies
                in the contract logic.
