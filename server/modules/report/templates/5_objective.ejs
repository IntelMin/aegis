    Aegis, an innovative smart contract auditor, stands at the forefront of this transformation. By harnessing the power
    of a fine-tuned LLM, Aegis has redefined the boundaries of automated auditing. This paper delves into the specific
    ways in which Aegis taps into the advancements brought forth by LLMs, providing a nuanced analysis of their impact
    on enhancing the security, efficiency, and adaptability of smart contract auditing.

    The integration of GPT-3.5 into Aegis allows for a deeper understanding of the context and complexities within smart
    contract code. The LLM's ability to recognize patterns, nuances, and potential vulnerabilities equips Aegis with a
    heightened capacity to automatically detect security risks. Through case studies and practical applications, we
    showcase how Aegis leverages the fine-tuned LLM to identify, report, and mitigate vulnerabilities, significantly
    reducing the manual effort traditionally associated with smart contract audits.
